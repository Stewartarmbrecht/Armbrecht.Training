Feature: Log Off from API
    As a system client 
    I should be able to log off from the API
    So that I can prevent others from accessing the API as the current user.

    Scenario: Valid API log in
	    Given the client is authenticated
          and the client can access a secure resource
         When the client logs off
         Then the client should not be authenticated
          and the client can not access a secure resource
