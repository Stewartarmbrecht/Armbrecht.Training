Feature: Log In to API
    As a system client 
    I should be able to log in to the API as a valid user 
    So that I can access the secure resources of the API

    Scenario: Valid API log in
	    Given the client is not authenticated
          and the client can not access a secure resource
         When the client logs in with valid credentials by saving a new user session
         Then the client user session should have a valid id
	      And the client can access a secure resource

    Scenario: API log in with invalid email
	    Given the client is not authenticated
          and the client can not access a secure resource
         When the client logs in with invalid email by saving a new user session
         Then the client should not be authenticated
          and the client can not access a secure resource

    Scenario: Invalid API with invalid password
	    Given the client is not authenticated
          and the client can not access a secure resource
         When the client logs in with invalid password by saving a new user session
         Then the client should not be authenticated
          and the client can not access a secure resource
