    I should be able to delete notes
    So that I can remove notes that are incorrect or are no longer relevant

    Scenario Outline: Delete Note As Creator
	    Given the client is connected as "NoteDelCreator"
          and the client saves <Count> new notes to the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>
          and the client should be able to query the API for the new note
         When the client deletes the note
         Then the client should NOT be able to query the API for the new note

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  | Count |
              | Patient     | NoteDelPatient    | 1     |
              | Appointment | NoteDelAppt       | 1     |
              | Order       | NoteDelOrder      | 1     |

          and the client is connected as "NoteDelNoPermission"
         When the client attempts to delete the note
         Then the client should receive a response with a status of "403"
          and the response message should be "Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation."

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  | Count |
              | Patient     | NoteDelPatient    | 1     |

          and the client is connected as "NoteDelPerm"
         When the client deletes the note
         Then the client should NOT be able to query the API for the new note
