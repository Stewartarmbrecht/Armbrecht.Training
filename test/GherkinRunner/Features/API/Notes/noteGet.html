    Feature Background Outline: Setup Notes 
        Given the client is connected as "NoteGetCreator"
          and the client saves <Count> new notes to the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  | Count |
              | Patient     | NoteGetPatient    | 15    |
              | Appointment | NoteGetAppt       | 15    |
              | Order       | NoteGetOrder      | 15    |

    Scenario Outline: Get Notes
	    Given the client is connected as "NoteGetPerm"
         When the client queries for the list of notes for the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>
         Then the system should return a list of "10" notes

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  |
              | Patient     | NoteGetPatient    |
              | Appointment | NoteGetAppt       |
              | Order       | NoteGetOrder      |

    Scenario Outline: Get Notes No Patient Access
	    Given the client is connected as "NoteGetPermNoPat"
         When the client attempts a query for the list of notes for the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>
         Then the client should receive a response with a status of "403"
          and the response message should be "No access to the specified patient."

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  |
              | Patient     | NoteGetPatient    |
              | Appointment | NoteGetAppt       |
              | Order       | NoteGetOrder      |

    Scenario Outline: Get Notes No Permission
	    Given the client is connected as "NoteGetNoPerm"
         When the client attempts a query for the list of notes for the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>
         Then the client should receive a response with a status of "403"
          and the response message should be "You do not have the necessary permission."

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  |
              | Patient     | NoteGetPatient    |
              | Appointment | NoteGetAppt       |
              | Order       | NoteGetOrder      |

    Scenario Outline: Get Single Note
        Given the client is connected as "NoteGetCreator"
          and the client saves <Count> new notes to the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>
         When the client queries the API for the new note
         Then the note should have the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName> as the parent
          and the queried "Note" properties should match the added "Note" properties for the following properties
              | Properties                                        |
              | id, topicId, topicRecordId, urgent, subject, body |
          and the created information should be set
          and the modified information should be set

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  | Count |
              | Patient     | NoteGetPatient    | 1     |

              | Order       | NoteGetOrder      | 1     |

    Scenario Outline: Get Single Note No Permission

          and the client saves <Count> new notes to the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>
          and the client is connected as "NoteGetNoPerm"
         When the client attempts to query the API for the new note
         Then the client should receive a response with a status of "403"
          and the response message should be "You do not have the necessary permission."

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  | Count |
