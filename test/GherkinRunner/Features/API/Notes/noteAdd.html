    Scenario Outline: Add Note
        Given the client is connected as "NoteAddEditor"
         When the client saves <Count> new notes to the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>
         Then the client should be able to query the API for the new note
          and the note should have the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName> as the parent
          and the queried "Note" properties should match the added "Note" properties for the following properties
              | Properties                                        |
              | id, topicId, topicRecordId, urgent, subject, body |
          and the created information should be set
          and the modified information should be set

              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  | Count |
              | Patient     | NoteAddPatient    | 1     |
              | Appointment | NoteAddAppt       | 1     |

        Given the client is connected as "NoteAddNoEditor"
         When the client attempts to save <Count> new notes to the <ObjectType> identified by <ParentObjectName>
         Then the client should receive a response with a status of "403"
          and the response message should be "Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation."

        Examples: 
              | ObjectType  | ParentObjectName  | Count |
