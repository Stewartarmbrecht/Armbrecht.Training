Feature: API Room Add
    As a system client connected as a user with the ability to manage rooms
    I should be able to add a room to the practice
    So that we can track where the patients are meeting with the provider

    Scenario: Add Room
	    Given the client is connected as a user who can manage rooms
          and the client adds a new location to the practice
         When the client adds a new room to the location of the practice
         Then the client should be able to get the new room from the API
