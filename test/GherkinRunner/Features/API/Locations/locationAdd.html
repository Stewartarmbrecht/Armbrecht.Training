Feature: API Location Add
    As a system client connected as a user with the ability to manage locations
    I should be able to add a location to the practice
    So that we can track the locations that a practice uses

    Scenario: Add Room
	    Given the client is connected as a user who can manage locations
         When the client adds a new location to the practice
         Then the client should be able to get the new location from the API
